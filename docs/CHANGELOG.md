### Major Updates
- Local image builds now work properly.
- Introduced a unified build script (`build.sh`).
  - Added the `--no-cache` option.
- Refactored `workspace`:
  - Modularized into clear functions and procedures.
  - First experimental implementation of **Docker-in-Docker (DinD)** via a sidecar container (attempted to isolate from the host — ultimately not fully successful).
  - Simplified configuration structure.
  - Prefixed all workspace-related environment variables with `CB_`.
  - Added `--unit-test` flag to skip running `Main()` for easier testing.
  - Added support for random or next-available port selection (`RANDOM` / `NEXT`).
- Reorganized setup scripts into **startup**, **profile**, and **starter** stages.
- Removed PowerShell support (maintenance overhead too high).
- Added multiple example configurations:
  - `dind`
  - `go`
  - `java`
  - `jetbrain`
  - `nodejs`
  - `python`
  - `server`
